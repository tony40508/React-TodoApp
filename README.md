# Redux
## What exactly is "Predictable State Container" in Redux, what should be the answer?
> Dan Abramov: It's a "state container" because it holds all the state of your application. 
> It doesn't let you change that state directly, but instead forces you to describe changes as plain > objects called "actions". Actions can be recorded and replayed later, so this makes state  >management predictable. With the same actions in the same order, you're going to end up in the same > state.
